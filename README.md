# private-ai-document-butler-app
Using n8n's power, "Private AI Document Butler" app runs entirely on your local machine using Docker. It monitors your "messy" local folder and uses local/private Ollama LLM to read, summarize, and move documents into organized folders (e.g., "Invoices," "Research," "Legal") on your machine based on their content.
